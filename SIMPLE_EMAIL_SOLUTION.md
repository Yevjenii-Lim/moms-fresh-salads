# Simple Email Solution - Works Right Now!

Since Netlify Forms isn't delivering emails reliably, here's a simple solution you can use immediately.

## 🎯 **Option 1: Use Netlify Dev (Local Testing)**

Your Netlify dev server is running at `http://localhost:8888`. This supports Netlify functions and should work better.

1. **Go to:** `http://localhost:8888`
2. **Test the contact form**
3. **Check the console logs** for detailed information

## 📧 **Option 2: Manual Email Collection**

For now, you can collect emails manually:

1. **Check Netlify Dashboard → Forms**
2. **View form submissions** (even if emails aren't working)
3. **Copy customer information** and respond manually

## 🚀 **Option 3: Quick EmailJS Setup (Recommended)**

This is the fastest way to get emails working:

### Quick Setup:

1. **Go to [emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com)**
2. **Sign up** (free)
3. **Add Gmail service** (connect your `yevhenii.lim27@gmail.com`)
4. **Create email template**
5. **Get your keys**

### Update Your Code:

Replace the demo values in `script.js` with your real EmailJS keys:

```javascript
const EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID = 'service_your_real_id';
const EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID = 'template_your_real_id';
const EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY = 'your_real_public_key';
```

## 🔍 **Current Status:**

- ✅ **Form is detected** by Netlify
- ✅ **Form submissions work** (shows success message)
- ❌ **Email delivery** not working reliably
- ✅ **All form data** is being collected

## 🎯 **Immediate Action:**

1. **Test with Netlify dev:** `http://localhost:8888`
2. **Check Netlify dashboard** for form submissions
3. **Set up EmailJS** for reliable email delivery

## 📱 **Form is Working:**

Your contact form is fully functional:
- ✅ Collects all customer information
- ✅ Shows success/error messages
- ✅ Mobile optimized
- ✅ Professional design

The only issue is email delivery, which EmailJS will solve quickly!

Would you like me to help you set up EmailJS, or would you prefer to test with the Netlify dev server first?
